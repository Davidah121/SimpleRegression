# SimpleRegression

<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>This application is another approach to create equations to best fit your data.</p>
<p>This approach is a combination of both the linear regression method (<a href="https://github.com/Davidah121/BasicLinearRegression">here</a>) and the polynomial method (<a href="https://github.com/Davidah121/BasicEquationCreations">here</a>).</p>
<p>This method requires 2 command line inputs. One of them is your input data and the other is the degree of your equation you want.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>This helped me understand linear regression more.</p>
<p>It allowed me to determine what cases I could use linear regression for and in turn, learn when I couldn't use it which lead to me studying more mathematics and learning about fourier transforms, splines, and bezier curves.</p>
<p>My abilities in linear algebra improved somewhat as well.</p>
